### Industrial Standard Architecture
It is a type of bus used in PCs for adding expansion cards. 

### Micro Channel Architecture
It allows data transfers between mains and children devices. It enables multiple devices and the system master to bid for control of the channel.

### Extended Industry Standard Architecture
It is a bus architecture designed to use a 32-bit data path and provided 32 address lines, giving access to 4GB of memory. It offered a disk-based setup for cards, but still ran at 8Mhz in order for it to be compatible with ISA.

### Video Electronics Standards Association
It was invented to help standardize PCs video specifications, thus solving the problem of proprietary technology where diffrent manufactures were trying to develop their own buses.

### Precautions
1. Fully shut down and unplug the computer before you make any attempts to disassemble the tower.

2. Take off any metal objects on your arms or fingers such as bracelets, rings or watches. Even if your unit is unplugged, there may still be some remaining electric charge.

3. Make sure your hands are completely dry to avoid damaging any mechanical parts as well as to avoid electrocution.

4. Work in a cool area to avoid perspiration for the same reason as seen in the previous number.

5. Before touching any part within the tower, put your hands against another metal surface (such as the computer casing) to remove static charge, which may damage sensitive devices.

6. Prepare a place to keep any screws you may remove. A container or piece of paper with labels for each part (casing, motherboard, CD drive, etc) is ideal to avoid confusion between the similar-looking screws.
